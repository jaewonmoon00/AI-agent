# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This appears to be a new/empty AI Agent project repository. The repository contains:
- An empty `.env` file (likely for environment variables)
- Claude Code configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Current Structure

The repository is currently minimal with only basic configuration files. There are no source code files, build configurations, or documentation files present yet.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, development setup will depend on the technology stack chosen for the AI Agent project. Common setups for AI projects include:

- **Python**: Typically uses `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Uses `package.json` and npm/yarn for dependencies
- **Mixed stack**: May combine frontend (React/Vue) with backend (Python/Node.js)

## Architecture Notes

This repository is ready for initial development of an AI Agent project. The architecture and components will need to be established as development progresses.

## Claude Code Configuration

The repository has Claude Code permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` allowing:
- `Bash(find:*)` - File system search operations
- `Bash(ls:*)` - Directory listing operations
